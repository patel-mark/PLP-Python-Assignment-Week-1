## Basic Calculator Program
### Description
This is a simple calculator program written in Python. It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program takes two numbers as input and an operation symbol (+, -, *, /) to compute the result.

### Features
Supported Operations:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Error Handling:

Displays an error message if an invalid operation is entered.

### How to Use
Run the program in a Python environment.
Follow the prompts to:
Enter the first number (a floating-point number).
Enter the mathematical operation (+, -, *, /).
Enter the second number (a floating-point number).
View the result of the operation or an error message if the operation is invalid.
Code Explanation
Input Variables:

first_number: Captures the first number as a float.
operation: Captures the mathematical operation as a string.
second_number: Captures the second number as a float.
Arithmetic Operations:

Addition: first_number + second_number
Subtraction: first_number - second_number
Multiplication: first_number * second_number
Division: first_number / second_number
Error Handling:

If the operation is not one of the supported symbols (+, -, *, /), an error message is displayed: "operation input error".
